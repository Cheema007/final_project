<!-- Final Project: End-to-End DevOps Deployment -->

### Project Overview 

In this project, we will focus on the hands-on implementation of the learnings throughout this program, where you will gain practical insights while setting up the entire DevOps cycle and deploying applications using acquired best practices. 

<br>

### Learning Objectives :notebook:

By the end of this project, you will: 

1. Apply DevOps practices to a real-world project in a production environment.
2. Build an effective CI/CD pipeline to automate delivery.
3. Automate provisioning, configuration and infrastructure management using Terraform and Ansible. 
4. Deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes. 
5. Integrate applications with Managed Kubernetes Service and other cloud services
6. Set up monitoring and create dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus
7. Resolve issues arising during the entire cycle using best practices

### Expense Tracker Project:
This project is a full-stack expense tracking application consisting of:

1. Frontend: Built with Next.js
2. Backend: Built with Node.js.
3. Database: MongoDB.
4. Caching: Redis.

Below are instructions for running the project locally, deploying to AWS EKS with Terraform, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

### Running the Project Locally:

Create Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend  
Create .dockerignore file to restrict unnecessary items, refer to the codebase



**Good luck!**
